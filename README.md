My SAP BTP SDK for Android Sample

This is a project that I created with the Wizard and customized it based on some Help docs and SAP Tutorials.
Currently anyone can use it since "API Key only" is the authentication method - type in anything in the Logon screen e.g. User: "a" and Password: "b". (A passcode is currently still needed.)

Tested with:
API level 29
Pixel 3
Android Studio 4.0
